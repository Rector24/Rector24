## üß∞ MY PROJECTS:  

*   **TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**: I was given a specific dataset to use to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily       available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. I used      the Python programming language.

*   **travelingWebsite)**: A traveling website project that I created for my cousin, for a school project he had for his CNA module, this was done using HTML/CSS.

*  ***Meal-Planning-and-Ordering-System**: This project focuses on developing an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application for the Belgium Campus to manage meal planning and ordering. As the campus expands
  its operations and collaborates with an independent entity, BC-Eats, this application aims to streamline the meal ordering process for both students and lecturers.
