### ABOUT ME:
I love turning concepts into useful solutions and am passionate about technology, innovation, and problem-solving.  With my years of knowledge in software development, I succeed in dynamic workplaces where creativity and technology meet.  From adjusting backend development to creating simple user experiences and solving complex challenges, I resolve each assignment with a different viewpoint and a commitment to performance.  My curiosity and drive for technology fuel my willingness to face difficulties that promote growth and innovative thinking.

### MY PROJECTS:
- ** TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**: I was given a specific dataset to use to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.I used the Python programming language.
